# penta-clock
A side by side comparison of a standard 12 hour clock, and a entirely custom
"five hour" clock.

This clock has the following features.

- One day has five "hours".
- Each "hour" has 125 "minutes"
- Each "minute" has 125 "seconds"

This produces interesting details

- One "penta second" and one standard second are of a similar length
- There is no "midnight", the middle of the night is half way through the third "hour".
- The five penta-hours loosely align with
   - Afternoon
   - Dusk
   - Night
   - Dawn
   - Morning
